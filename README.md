Heart Disease Prediction
Project Description
This project, Heart Disease Prediction, is a machine learning model that aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health parameters. The model is trained on a dataset that includes parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type,
resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and others.
The goal of this project is to help healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease by providing them with a preliminary prediction. It can also be used by individuals to understand their heart health better and take necessary precautions if required.
Please note that while this tool strives to provide accurate predictions, it should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns.

Features
Data preprocessing and analysis
Feature selection
Model training and evaluation
User-friendly interface for entering health parameters and receiving a prediction
Technologies Used
Python for implementing the machine learning model
Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning

This project is open-source and contributions are welcome.
